# Dotfiles

My dotfiles are managed with [rcm][1] and are a combination of the configuration
files and overrides in this repository and those in [thoughtbot dotfiles][2].

## Prerequisites

[Homebrew][3] must be installed.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/korabh/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/install
```
